-> The main objective of this project was to detect the soil moisture content within the soil and depending on that it'll start sprinkling the water automatically.
-> The project describes how irrigation is possible by handling smartly using IoT.
-> It also helps in conserving water by automatically providing water to the Plants or fields looking forward to what quantity of water is required.
-> During this IoT system, all the information that is received from the sensors and thus the varied parameters are given to the Arduino Uno microcontroller as an analog input.
